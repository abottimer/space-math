# 🚀 Space Math Mission

A math practice app for Austin (2nd grade) — addition and subtraction with a space theme.

## Concept

**Mission:** Travel from Pluto to the Sun by solving math problems!

- Start at Pluto (cold, far away)
- Each correct answer = move one planet closer to the Sun
- Problems get harder as you progress
- Reach the Sun = Victory!

## Features

- **Vertical problem display** (like paper worksheets)
- **Drag-and-drop number tiles** (0-9) for answers
- **Scratchpad canvas** for working out problems (carrying, borrowing)
- **Planet progression** with animations
- **Sound effects** and celebrations

## Difficulty Progression
